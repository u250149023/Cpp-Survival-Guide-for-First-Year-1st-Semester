# Relational Operators
Relational operators are used in programming to compare two values or expressions. These operators evaluate the relationship between the operands and return a boolean value: true if the relationship holds, and false otherwise. Relational operators are fundamental for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program.

Common Relational Operators:

Equal To (==):
Checks if two values are equal.
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 5;
bool result = (a == b); // result is true
```

Not Equal To (!=):
Checks if two values are not equal.
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
bool result = (a != b); // result is true
```

Greater Than (>):
Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
```cpp
int a = 7;
int b = 5;
bool result = (a > b); // result is true
```

Less Than (<):
Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
```cpp
int a = 3;
int b = 5;
bool result = (a < b); // result is true
```

Greater Than or Equal To (>=):
Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 5;
bool result = (a >= b); // result is true
```

Less Than or Equal To (<=):
Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
```cpp
int a = 4;
int b = 5;
bool result = (a <= b); // result is true
```
