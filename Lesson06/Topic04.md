# Array Traversal
Array traversal is the process of accessing and processing each element of an array, typically in a sequential manner. This operation is fundamental in programming because it allows you to examine, modify, or utilize each element within the array.

## Tips for Array Traversal in C++
1. Efficient Looping:
- Tip: Optimize your loop conditions to minimize repeated calculations.
- Example: Store the length of the array in a variable instead of calculating it in every loop iteration.
```cpp
int length = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Process arr[i]
}
```
2. Boundary Checking:
- Tip: Always check your loop boundaries to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements, which can lead to undefined behavior.
- Example: Use conditions to ensure the loop index remains within the valid range of the array.
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < length) {
    if (i >= 0 && i < length) {
        // Process arr[i]
    }
    i++;
}
```
3. Nested Loop Traversal:
- Tip: For multidimensional arrays, use nested loops carefully to ensure all elements are accessed correctly.
- Example: Nested loops for 2D or 3D arrays should accurately reflect the structure of the array.
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        // Process matrix[i][j]
    }
}
```
4. Conditional Traversal:
- Tip: Use conditions within your loops to filter or modify specific elements based on criteria.
- Example: Apply a condition to only process even numbers in the array.
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % 2 == 0) {
        // Process even elements
    }
}
```
5. Use do-while for Guaranteed Execution:
- Tip: Use a do-while loop when you need the loop to run at least once, regardless of the condition.
- Example: Useful for scenarios where you must process at least the first element before further conditions.
```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
    // Process arr[i]
    i++;
} while
```
