# Array Traversal
Array traversal is the process of accessing and processing each element of an array, typically in a sequential manner. This operation is fundamental in programming because it allows you to examine, modify, or utilize each element within the array.

Key Concepts of Array Traversal:
- Initialization: Setting up the loop with an initial index, often starting at 0.
- Condition: Checking a condition to ensure the loop runs as long as there are elements to process.
- Iteration: Incrementing or updating the loop index to move to the next element.
