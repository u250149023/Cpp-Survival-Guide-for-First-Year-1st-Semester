# C++ Overview

**C++** is a powerful and adaptable language that evolved from **C** and was created by *Bjarne Stroustrup* in the early 1980s. Renowned for its object-oriented capabilities, **C++** is widely utilized in system programming, game development, and sophisticated software applications. This guide thoroughly explores the language, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced topics like templates and exception handling, with clear explanations and practical code examples.

## Basic Structure

**C++** program is made up of one or more functions, starting with the `main()` function. The typical structure of a **C++** program includes:

- **Header Files**: Include statements for standard library functions and classes.
- **Namespace Declaration**: Using `namespace std;` to avoid prefixing with `std::`.
- **Function Definitions**: Including the `main()` function where execution starts.
- **Statements and Expressions**: To perform operations and computations.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Headers 

In **C++**, header files are used to declare functions and classes. The standard library headers generally do not have a `.h` extension. Some frequently used headers are:

- `<iostream>`: For standard input and output stream objects like cin and cout.
- `<vector>`: For using the vector container.
- `<string>`: To use the string class.
- `<algorithm>`: For common algorithms like sort, search, etc.
- `<cmath>`: For mathematical functions.
```cpp
1	#include <iostream>  // Standard I/O
2	#include <vector>    // Vector container
3	// Other headers...
```
## Syntax Rules
**Syntax** rules in programming refer to the guidelines and conventions that determine the structure of a valid program. These rules ensure that the code is properly formatted and can be interpreted correctly by the compiler or interpreter.

**C++** syntax is derived from **C** and includes the following:

- **Case Sensitivity**: C++ distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Semicolons**: Every statement must end with a semicolon.
- **Braces**: Braces define the scope of functions and control structures.
```cpp
1	int main() {
2	    int a = 5;
3	    a++;
4	    cout << a;  // Outputs 6
5	    return 0;
6	}
```
## Comments
**Comments** in programming are annotations that explain the code, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the program's execution.

- **Single-Line** Comments: Begin with `//` and continue to the end of the line.
- **Multi-Line** Comments: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/`, can span multiple lines.
```cpp
1	// This is a single-line comment
2	/* This is a
3	   multi-line comment */
```

## Variables
**Variables** are essential storage units in C++ programming. Here are the rules for naming variables:
- **Start with a Letter or Underscore**: Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_).
- **Alphanumeric and Underscores**: Variable names can include letters, digits, and underscores.
- **Avoid Reserved Keywords**: Reserved words in C++ (such as `class`, `void`, `int`, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.
- **Case Sensitivity**: C++ is case-sensitive, meaning `Variable`, `variable`, and `VARIABLE` are considered different.
```cpp
1	int mainCount;
2	float totalPrice;
3	bool isValid;
```

## Data Types
**Data types** define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. **C++** supports a variety of data types:
- **Basic Data Types**: These include `int` (integer), `char` (character), `float` (floating-point), and `double` (double precision floating-point).
- **Derived Data Types**: These include `arrays` (collections of elements), `pointers` (variables that store memory addresses), and user-defined types such as `classes`.

## Constant 
**Constants** are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program. They are used to define data that remains the same, providing a way to protect critical values from being altered.

- **Literals**: Directly assigned constant values like `42`, `'A'`, `3.14`, `"Hello, World!"`.
- **const Keyword**: Used to declare `constants`. Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed.
```cpp
1	const int MAX_SIZE = 100;
```
## Reserved Words
**Reserved words** (also known as keywords) are predefined words in **C++** that have special meaning to the compiler. These words cannot be used as identifiers (such as **variable names**, **function names**, etc.) because they are part of the **C++ syntax**.

- **Data Types**: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `void`, `bool`
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `break`, `continue`
- **Access Specifiers**: `public`, `private`, `protected`
- **Class Related**: `class`, `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `new`, `delete`, `this`
- **Other Keywords**: `return`, `const`, `static`, `extern`, `register`, `sizeof`, `typedef`, `namespace`, `using`
